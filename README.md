# UBE2E3: Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzyme E2 E3 - A Study on Its Role in Human Genetics

## Introduction

The UBE2E3 gene encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in the critical process of protein ubiquitination. Ubiquitination is a key post-translational modification that regulates protein stability, cellular signaling, and various metabolic pathways. This study aims to analyze UBE2E3 at the genomic level, examining its sequence, function, evolutionary conservation, and potential role in disease pathology.

In addition to UBE2E3, this project includes a broader analysis of gene expression patterns, evolutionary conservation across species, and chromatin accessibility in regulatory regions. By integrating multiple datasets and computational approaches, this study provides a holistic view of genome functionality and transcriptional regulation.
